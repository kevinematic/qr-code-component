## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Custom fonts

### What I learned

I am reinforcing my ability to add custom fonts. I understand that there are several ways to do this and I'm planning to do some further studies on understanding the most performant solutions. In this project I used the @font-face rule which allowed me to use custom fonts on the site. I added the fonts I needed into the fonts folder and used the @font-face rule as follows:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Outfit";
  src: url("./fonts/Outfit-Regular.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: "Outfit";
  src: url("./fonts/Outfit-Bold.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: bold;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

### Continued development
